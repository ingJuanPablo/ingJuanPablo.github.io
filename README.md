## Welcome to my service portfolio



Hello, I am a computer and systems engineer at the Universidad del Quindío.
I have worked on various projects such as mobile application development for Android operating system, I have also had the opportunity to be close to the development in C ++ for IoT devices such as Esp32 and Arduino, currently (2020), I am part of a research group that offers a large amount of services in the field of usability and HCI. Thanks to my time in the research group I have managed to add to my abilities a series of techniques to achieve a user interface design with a high level of usability, however my focus and interest is in the study of different algorithms and libraries in Python to offer solutions through artificial intelligence and machine learning.

### Android Development Experience

These are some of the interfaces designed and developed for one of the subjects of my professional career.
